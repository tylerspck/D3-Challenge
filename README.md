## Object 
I want to create a customizeable visualization that compares health risk factors (obesity, smoking status and healthcare access) that different demographics (poverty level, household income and age) face in each U.S. state.   

## Data Set 
U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml

* Tech Environment: D3, Javascript, HTML5, GitHub, VSCode
